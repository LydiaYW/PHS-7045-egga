# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2024-08-04 00:44:06.

    > However, limited tools are available for retailers to assess
    > practices that can enhance control of Listeria transmission to
    > fresh produce. Therefore, we developed an agent-based model that

    > Further, many data-driven approaches consist of abstract internal
    > representations that may have no obvious connection to the
    > underlying dynamics and control, or, require extensive model
    > design and training. Here, we remove these constraints by

    > We numerically integrated the model’s master equations that
    > perfectly describe the system’s dynamics and found that
    > ideological sorting only emerges in models that include
    > pairwise-coherence favoritism. We then compared the model’s
    > outcomes with …
