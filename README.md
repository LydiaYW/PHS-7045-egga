# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2024-06-16 00:42:14.

    10.1073/pnas.2403491121. Epub 2024 Jun 14.

    > Here, we hypothesize that these two axes of variation are causally
    > related to each other, such that extended dependence of offspring
    > on maternal presence leads to the evolution of longer lives at the
    > expense of reproduction. We use a combination of deterministic
    > modeling a …

    > While the bulk of the past work has focused on using EVs to
    > increase the resilience of the distribution grid, or individual
    > buildings, to a power outage, this paper was novel in its use of
    > an agent-based model to study EVs that are performing functions to
    > inc …

5.  **Agent-based modeling to estimate the impact of lockdown scenarios
    and events on a pandemic exemplified on SARS-CoV-2.**

    Sci Rep. 2024 Jun 11;14(1):13391. doi: 10.1038/s41598-024-63795-1.

    > In actual pandemic situations like COVID-19, it is important to
    > understand the influence of single mitigation measures as well as
    > combinations to create most dynamic impact for lockdown scenarios.
    > Therefore we created an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate th …
