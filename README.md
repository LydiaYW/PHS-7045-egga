# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2024-06-02 00:40:52.

    > Agent-based models of opinion formation are becoming increasingly

    > Unfortunately, monitoring changes in genetic diversity from
    > management actions such as assisted migration and predicting the
    > extent of introduced genetic variation that is needed to prevent
