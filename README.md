# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-05-07 00:39:28.

    > In this paper, we demonstrate a different approach to the
    > mathematical modelling of interventions, not based on optimality
    > or cases, but based on demand and capacity of hospitals who have
    > to deal with the epidemic on a day to day basis. In particular, we
    > use …

4.  **Are all underimmunized measles clusters equally critical?**

    Moon SA, Marathe A, Vullikanti A.

    > This research develops a system science approach to examine the
    > potential risk of geographical clustering of underimmunized
    > individuals for an infectious disease like measles. We use an
    > activity-based population network model and school immunization
    > records to ident …

5.  **Assessing the economic ripple effect of flood disasters in light
