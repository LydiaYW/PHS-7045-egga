# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-09-17 00:35:57.

    > In this study, we investigated the impact of uncertainty
    > (epistemic and aleatory) on nosocomial transmission of HAIs by
    > evaluating the effects of stochasticity on the detectability of
    > seasonality of admission prevalence. For doing so, we developed an
