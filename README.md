# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2024-03-24 00:39:20.

    > To this end, we introduce an agent-based model (ABM)
    > representation of the interactions between immune cells and
    > bacteria in an in vitro setting. This in silico model was used to

    > Emerging data suggests that the combination of these two therapies
    > could lead to improved clinical outcomes, but the optimal strategy

    > Prompted by the ubiquity of empirical observations of critical
    > phenomena, often in non-equilibrium macrostates, we developed a
    > modelling approach in which several critical phenomena coexist.
    > Instead of a single critical point, many coexisting critical
    > points in the system …

5.  **How individuals’ opinions influence society’s resistance to
    epidemics: an agent-based model approach.**

    > However, a comprehensive understanding of the effects of
    > opinion-related factors on disease spread still requires further
    > exploration. METHODS: We propose an agent-based simulation
    > framework incorporating opinion dynamics within an epidemic model
    > based on the …

    > Existing work is hindered by a reliance on observational data
    > which is only available well after the fact. In this work, we
    > study the efficacy of a data-driven agent-based framework
    > motivated by social and behavioral theory in predicting outflow of
