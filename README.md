# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-08-20 00:34:15.

    > This research develops a novel system science approach to examine
    > the potential risk of outbreaks caused by geographical clustering
    > of underimmunized individuals for an infectious disease like

    eCollection 2023 Aug.

    > When ecological factors do not limit primate group size, the
    > problem of coordination creates an upper threshold even when
    > cooperation is guaranteed. This paper offers a model of group
    > coordination towards behavioural synchrony to spell out the
    > mechanics of group size limit …

4.  **The form of uncertainty affects selection for social learning.**

    Turner MA, Moya C, Smaldino PE, Jones JH.

    eCollection 2023.

    > When these combine, it is nearly impossible to fully learn about
    > the environment. We develop an evolutionary agent-based model to
    > test how each form of uncertainty affects the evolution of social
    > learning. Agents perform one of several behaviours, modelled …

5.  **Statistical signals of copying are robust to time- and
    space-averaging.**

    > In this preregistered study, we used a dataset of \~81,000 Kansas
    > cattle brands (1990-2016) to explore two aspects: (1) the relative
    > influence of copying, pressure for distinctiveness and pressure
    > for complexity on the creation and diffusion of brand components;
    > and (2) the effect …
