# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-07-09 00:52:57.

1.  **Feedback Loops in Opinion Dynamics of Agent-Based Models with
    Multiplicative Noise.**

    Entropy (Basel). 2022 Sep 24;24(10):1352. doi: 10.3390/e24101352.

    > We introduce an agent-based model for co-evolving opinions and
    > social dynamics, under the influence of multiplicative noise. In
    > this model, every agent is characterized by a position in a social
