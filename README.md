# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-04-18 19:18:56.

1.  **Emergent regulation of ant foraging frequency through a
    computationally inexpensive forager movement rule.**

    Baltiansky L, Frankel G, Feinerman O.

    Elife. 2023 Apr 17;12:e77659. doi: 10.7554/eLife.77659.

    > Instead of an explicit decision to exit, foragers merely tend
    > toward the depth of the nest when their food load is high and
    > toward the nest exit when it is low. Thus, the colony shapes the
    > forager’s trajectory by controlling her unloading rate, while she
    > senses only her cu …

    lockdown: Mathematical modeling of control measures.**
