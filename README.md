# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2024-04-14 00:39:46.

    > While previous studies have highlighted the role of network
    > structure in language change, the specific aspects of network
    > structure that shape language variability remain largely unknown.

    > We used historical maritime movement data in combination with an
    > agent-based model to understand invasion risk in the United States
    > Gulf Coast and how the risk of these invasions could be reduced.

4.  **Optimization of periodic treatment strategies for bacterial
    biofilms using an agent-based in silico approach.**

    10.1098/rsif.2024.0078. Epub 2024 Apr 10.

    > Because the dynamics and mechanisms of biofilm growth and the
    > formation of persister cells are diverse and are affected by
    > environmental conditions, it remains a challenge to design optimal
    > periodic dosing regimens. Here, we develop a computational
    > agent-based mo …

5.  **Measuring the communicative constitution of organization as
    network formation.**

    > We propose a set of metrics, based upon the four flows theory of
    > the communicative constitution of organizations, to evaluate the
    > emergence of organization in a social network. Using an
    > agent-based model (ABM), we validate that our metrics chart the
    > evolution …
