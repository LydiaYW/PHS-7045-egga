# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-12-03 00:38:43.

    > Why bacteria have evolved such a wide array of weapon systems
    > remains a mystery. Here we develop an agent-based model to compare
    > short-range weapons that require cell-cell contact, with
    > long-range weapons that rely on diffusion. Our model predicts that

    > An agent-based model is created, offering the option to apply
    > either EMV or PT frameworks. …The results demonstrate that PT
    > models exhibit greater similarity to observed behavior compared to
    > models based on EMV. …
