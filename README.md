# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2024-07-28 00:44:18.

    > The dynamics of rubella transmission were explored using EMOD, a
    > software tool for building stochastic, agent-based infection

    > The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential for HD
    > outbreaks to buffer CWD risk where the diseases co-occur. Using an
    > agent-based modeling approach, we found that frequent, intense HD
    > outbreaks have the potential to mitigate CWD risk, especially …

    > While the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has assessed the
    > risk to human health related to the presence of PFAS in food, in

    > considered as the most critical human health effect, a
    > comprehensive grasp of the mole …

5.  **Imitation versus serendipity in ranking dynamics.**

    De Domenico F, Caccioli F, Livan G, Montagna G, Nicrosini O.

    eCollection 2024 Jul.

    > We investigate the tradeoff between imitation and serendipity in
    > an agent-based model. Agents in the model receive payoffs based on
    > their actions and may switch to different actions by either
    > imitating others or through random selection. …

6.  **Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulation for modelling animal
    territorial behaviour.**

    Guillermo-Ferreira R, Filippov AE, Kovalev A, Gorb SN.

    eCollection 2024 Jul.

    > We explore the use of movable automata in numerical modelling of
    > male competition for territory. We used territorial dragonflies as
    > our biological inspiration for the model, assuming two types of
    > competing males: (a) faster and larger males that adopt a face-off

    eCollection 2024 Jul.

    > Recently, experiments have revealed that organisms such as fish
    > and insects selectively utilize a portion, rather than the
    > entirety, of visual information. Here, focusing on fish, we
    > propose an agent-based model where the direction of attention is
    > guided by v …
