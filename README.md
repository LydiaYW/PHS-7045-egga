# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-04-30 00:41:02.

    Epub 2022 Aug 15.

    > To effectively address food security, we need tools that assess
    > governance measures (for example, strategic storage reserves, cash
    > transfers or trade regulations) ex ante. Simulation models can

    > In Brussels, freight transport generates 61,604 of air pollution
    > health costs daily. Research has shown that dynamic spatiotemporal
    > modeling of both emission sources and exposed people (using mobile
    > phone data) renders more accurate impact results when analyzed in

    > Migration of cancer cells often proceeds by penetration through
    > narrow cavities in locally stiff, yet flexible tissues. In our
    > previous work, we developed a model for cell geometry evolution
    > during invasion, which we extend here to investigate whether

    > In effect, this calibrated parameter absorbs residual variation in
    > the abundance time-series not captured by other features of the
    > mechanistic model. We then used this calibrated parameter and the
