# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2024-09-15 00:50:07.

    > tumor microenvironment or quantify the influence of
    > spatially-dependent characteristics of tumor-immune dynamics. For

    > It is thus conceivable that spatially fractionated radiotherapy
    > (SFRT), administered through GRID blocks (SFRT-GRID) or lattice
    > radiotherapy to create areas of low or high dose exposure, may
    > create protective reservoirs of the tumor immune microenvironment,

    > Although the principles of coral clonal growth, involving polyp
    > division for spatial extension, are well-understood, numerical
    > modelling efforts are notably scarce in the literature. In this
    > article, we present a parsimonious numerical model based on the

    > What makes this process so fascinating is the self-organization of
    > ants into trails using chemical pheromone in the absence of direct
    > communication. Here we present a stochastic lattice model that
