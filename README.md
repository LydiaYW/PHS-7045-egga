# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-12-10 00:39:24.

    > With the aim of generating a more complete and integrated
    > understanding of how the epithelium maintains homeostasis and
    > recovers after injury, we have built a multi-scale agent-based

    > The effects of toxic comments are potentially even greater in the
    > long term, as they are associated with a significantly increased
    > risk of editors leaving the project altogether. Using an
