# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-11-19 00:41:10.

    Sci Rep. 2023 Nov 17;13(1):20152. doi: 10.1038/s41598-023-46789-3.

    > When agent-based models are developed to capture opinion formation
    > in large-scale populations, the opinion update equations often
    > need to embed several complex psychological traits. …We exemplify
    > the proposed technique by applying it to four opinion formati …

    > In this paper, we propose a novel approach for a simulator of
    > nosocomial infection spread, combining agent-based patient
    > description, spatial-temporal constraints of the hospital
    > settings, and microorganism behavior driven by epidemiological
