# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-09-24 00:36:15.

    > In this study, we have developed a novel cationic surfactant-based
    > sclerosing agent (POL-TA) by conjugating the plasmin inhibitor
    > tranexamic acid (TA) with a nonionic surfactant polidocanol (POL)

    > Why do we even use words like “moral” and “immoral”? We explore
    > these questions with a new model of how people perceive moral

    > In this work, we show how N -allele fitness seascapes allow for N
    > 2 (N- 1) unique MSW comparisons. In spatial drug diffusion models,
    > we demonstrate how fitness seascapes reveal spatially

    > Current theory suggests that the heterogeneity of metapopulation
