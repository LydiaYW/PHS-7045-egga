# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-09-10 00:35:35.

    > We studied how interventions implemented at different levels might
    > reduce the spread of GW disease (geographically and over time) and

    > Reciprocally, viral proteins often interfere with IFN synthesis
    > and IFN-induced signaling. We modeled the crosstalk between the
    > propagating virus and the innate immune response using an

    > Live fish showed no difference in their response to ‘real’
    > movement compared to movement simulated by the model, although
    > significantly preferred modelled movement over putatively
    > unnatural movement patterns. The model therefore has the potential
    > to facilitat …

    > To understand the initial stages of biofilm formation, one needs
    > to study the interactions between cells, the fluid and the
    > confining geometries. Here, we present an agent based numerical
