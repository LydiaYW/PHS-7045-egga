# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2024-09-08 00:47:51.

    > The models utilized a multi-agent simulation process, focusing on
    > a 10-year period (1986-1995). …A range of values for input data

    > Despite the critical relevance of face-to-face interactions in
    > real-world situations, there is a significant lack of
    > comprehensive study addressing the unique issues of mixed groups,

    > To do so, we develop a Collective Asymmetric Reinforcement
    > Learning (CARL) model in which artificial agents observe others’
    > actions and rewards, and update this information asymmetrically.
    > We use agent-based simulations to study how confirmation bias
    > affects …

4.  **The contribution of movement to social network structure and
    spreading dynamics under simple and complex transmission.**

    > Here, we examine the effect of the social-spatial interface on
    > spreading dynamics using a simulation model. We quantify the
    > relative effects of different movement rules (localized,
    > semi-localized, nomadic and resource-based movement) and social
    > transmission rules (simple t …

5.  **The influence of social and spatial processes on the epidemiology
