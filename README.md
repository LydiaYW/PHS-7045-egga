# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2024-04-07 00:39:12.

    > How workers spatially distribute within the colony, or spatial
    > heterogeneity degree (SHD), plays a vital role in contact
    > dynamics, influencing information spread and task allocation. We

    > BACKGROUND: Monte Carlo (MC) is often used when trying to assess
    > the consequences of uncertainty in agent-based models (ABMs).
    > However, this approach is not appropriate when the uncertainty is
    > epistemic rather than aleatory, that is, when it represents a lack

4.  **Agent-based modeling of stress anisotropy driven nematic ordering
    in growing biofilms.**
