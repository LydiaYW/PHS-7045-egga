# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-10-08 00:36:53.

    Epub 2023 Oct 6.

    > Multivariate analysis revealed that an Eastern Cooperative
    > Oncology Group performance status over two and a platelet count
    > below 100 10(9)/L were independently associated with worse OS,
    > leading to the development of a simplified decision tree model.
    > The model’s …

2.  **The leakage effect may undermine the circular economy efforts.**

    Safarzynska K, Di Domenico L, Raberto M.

    > To this end, we make an input-output analysis dynamic by combining
    > it with an agent-based model of the capital sector. This approach
    > allows us to study the evolution of the circular economy due to
    > the endogenous decisions of firms on whether to invest in the …

3.  **Stroma-mediated breast cancer cell proliferation indirectly drives
    chemoresistance by accelerating tumor recovery between chemotherapy
    cycles.**

    ahead of print.

    > These observations suggested an indirect link between stroma and
    > chemoresistance, where stroma-augmented proliferation potentiates
    > the recovery of residual tumors between chemotherapy cycles. To
    > evaluate this hypothesis, a spatial agent-based model of stroma …

4.  **From parts to whole: Embracing systems science in community
    psychology.**

    > acting on social problems, community psychologists have frequently
    > elevated the importance of employing systems thinking and methods
    > that help us to understand systems more effectively. …

5.  **Unraveling complex causal processes that affect sustainability
    requires more integration between empirical and modeling
    approaches.**

    Schlüter M, Brelsford C, Ferraro PJ, Orach K, Qiu M, Smith MD.

    > Here, we demonstrate how sustainability scientists can address
    > these challenges and make more robust causal claims through better
    > integration between empirical analyses and process- or agent-based
    > modeling. To illustrate how these different epistemological tr …

6.  **Predicting longitudinal brain atrophy in Parkinson’s disease using

    > over 4 years from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative
    > (1,068 T1 MRI scans, 790 Parkinson’s disease scans, and 278
    > matched control scans). We find that brain deformation progresses
