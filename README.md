# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-09-03 00:35:16.

    > Two kinds of movement, namely undirected random and
    > pressure-driven movements, are considered: the continuum limit of
    > the models is derived and a systematic comparison between the

4.  **Suppression force-fields and diffuse competition: competition

    eCollection 2023 Aug.

    > Diffuse competition is unintuitive in part because we lack a clear
    > conceptual framework for understanding how individual interactions
    > manifest in communities of multiple competitors. Here, I use
    > mathematical and agent-based models to illustrate that diffuse i …
