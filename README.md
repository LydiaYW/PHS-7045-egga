# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-08-27 00:35:08.

    10.3390/vaccines11081312.

    > Population heterogeneities in underlying (pre-vaccination)
    > susceptibility and vaccine response can cause measured vaccine
    > effectiveness (mVE) to change over time, even in the absence of

    > We propose a new agent-based model for studying wealth
    > distribution. We show that a model that links wealth to
