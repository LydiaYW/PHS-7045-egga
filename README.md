# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-05-21 00:41:12.

    > To understand the effects of such competition, we develop a
    > stochastic agent-based simulation that models competitive foraging
    > among mutually avoiding individuals by incorporating an avoidance
    > zone, or territory, of a certain size around each forager which is

    > BACKGROUND: Complex systems models of breast cancer have
    > previously focused on prediction of prognosis and clinical events

    ArXiv. 2023 May 12:arXiv:2305.01737v2. Preprint.

    > Population heterogeneities in underlying (pre-vaccination)
    > susceptibility and vaccine response can cause measured vaccine
    > effectiveness (mVE) to change over time even in the absence of
    > pathogen evolution and any actual waning of immune responses. We
    > use a multi-scale agent …

    > (ABM) approach with the aim of simulating patient flow acro …

6.  **Is the neighborhood of interaction in human crowds metric,
    topological, or visual?**

    Wirth TD, Dachner GC, Rio KW, Warren WH.

    PNAS Nexus. 2023 May 16;2(5):pgad118. doi:
    10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad118. eCollection 2023 May.

    > Both metric and topological neighborhoods have been reported in
    > animal groups, but this question has not been addressed for human
    > crowds. The answer has important implications for modeling crowd
    > behavior and predicting crowd disasters such as jams, crushes, and
    > stampedes. …

    Epub 2023 May 12.

    > As social aspects remain understudied drivers for agricultural
    > decisions, we also consider value-based characteristics of farmers
    > as internal factors relevant for decision-making. We integrate
    > individual learning as response to extreme weather events into an
