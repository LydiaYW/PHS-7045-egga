# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2024-02-11 00:37:41.

4.  **A newly detected bias in self-evaluation.**

    Deffuant G, Roubin T, Nugier A, Guimond S.

    10.1371/journal.pone.0296383. eCollection 2024.

    > The widely observed positive bias on self-evaluation is mainly
    > explained by the self-enhancement motivation which minimizes
    > negative feedbacks and emphasizes positive ones. Recent agent
    > based simulations suggest that a positive bias also emerges if the
    > sensitivity t …

5.  **Dynamic simulation for reclaimed water reuse under
