# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2024-02-25 00:37:32.

    > In particular, we consider the pairwise (between stocks i, j)
    > partial correlations of returns with respect to the market mode,
    > ci,j(tau), (thus, correcting for the baseline return behavior of
    > the market), over different time horizons (tau), and discover two

    > In this paper, we investigate two variants of the q-voter model
    > with independence. Following the original q-voter model, in the
    > first one, among the q members of the influence group, each given

    > In this work, we abstract this theory into a low-dimensional and
    > stylized model of two classes of networked agents, hereafter
    > referred to as “laborers” and “administrators”. We numerically
    > model the dynamics of societal complexity, measured as the
    > fraction of “admin …

4.  **An Agent-Based Model to Reproduce the Boolean Logic Behaviour of

    > modelled. Neurological processes have logical signal-processing
    > and biophysical aspects, and both affect the brain’s structure,
    > functioning and adaptation. …Several simulations are carried out
