# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2023-11-12 00:37:41.

    > However, this process may lead to a paradoxical dependence of
    > model parameters on location-specific data, thus limiting the
    > model’s geographic transferability. METHODS: In this study, we
    > adopted a non-local model calibration approach to assess whether …
