# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egge\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2024-01-28 00:37:15.

    > We develop an agent-based model that simulates household and
    > government agents adapting to shoreline change and increasing

    > This work proposes the design of an artificial photo-protease
    > agent based on a PEGylated mercury porphyrin, able to form a
    > stable complex with l-Tryptophan, an amino acid present also in

    > explored the problem of non-identifiability in a stochastic system
    > which, when overlooked, can significantly impede model predic …
